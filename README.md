# Ars Nouveau - Extended Glyphs

Extended Glyphs is an early-in-development extension to Ars Nouveau that add a handful of (likely poorly balanced) glyphs. It also adds a new material, Magestone, which is used in a handful of recipes and pieces of equipment.

Many of the glyphs added are more chaotic than not, and serve more to diversify potential spells rather than simply improving already existing combos.

 

Also, this was made for a group of friends (and myself), so most of the balancing here is just based on what we deem fun or not.

Wow!

 
Additions

    Magestone (and Refined Magestone) - A material obtained via the use of Ars Nouveau's enchanting system on a Source Gem Block and a Lapis Lazuli Block. It can be used as a material for certain glyphs in this form, but it can be refined into a versatile crafting material and spell focus.
    Spell Effects - 10 unique effects that (as far as I know) only exist here. Probably for a good reason, though.
    More Spell Forms/Augments - We added a whopping ONE form and ONE augment! And the augment is used by only TWO effects! Hopefully, though, this mod will see more forms and augments that fit its gimmicky nature.
